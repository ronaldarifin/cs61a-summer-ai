# cs61a-summer-ai

To understand the material of what we went during class.

It will be better to review these material

The order is as follows:

1. basics.py
This file goes over the difference between class attribute, instance attribute, local variables

2. supers.py
This file checks the understanding of inheritance and super(). Super() is a function that allows you to access the parent class.
To know the parent class, generally we have Class(ParentClass) to inherit from the parent class.

3. concepts.py
This file checks the pitfalls for the rules that we have. 
a. For example, the difference between class attribute and instance attribute.
b. The mistake of forgetting instance, class, and super class searching

4. exam.py
an exam question we went together in class.
